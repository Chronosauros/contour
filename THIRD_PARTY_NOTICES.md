# Third-party notices

Contour is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (see `LICENSE`). This file lists everything
Contour uses that someone else made: the libraries inside the app, code and knowledge it builds on, and the
tools used to build it. The app shows this file, `NOTICE` and `LICENSE` on its licences screen (long-press
the device status, then Licences).

Summary:
- Every library inside the app is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
- The only code from another project is a port of the WalkPlay protocol and coefficient maths from
  devicePEQ, licensed under 0BSD (section 2).
- The app bundles no fonts, images, sounds or data made by others.

## 1. Libraries inside the app (all Apache License 2.0)

## 2. Code and knowledge Contour builds on

devicePEQ, https://github.com/jeromeof/devicePEQ, commit 0617f382e76629792a5933e6933e4b396a756a93.
The WalkPlay HID PEQ protocol and the biquad coefficient maths in
`android/core/src/main/kotlin/io/github/chronosauros/contour/core/WalkPlay.kt` and `research/protocol/walkplay.py`
are ports of devicePEQ's `walkplayHidHandler.js`. `research/protocol/devicepeq-ref/` keeps verbatim reference
copies of four devicePEQ files. devicePEQ is licensed under 0BSD:

    Copyright 2024 Jerome O'Flaherty (jerome.oflaherty@icloud.com)

    Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any
    purpose with or without fee is hereby granted.

    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH
    REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
    AND FITNESS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, DIRECT,
    INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM
    LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR
    OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR
    PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

The protocol was then checked on a real CrinEar Protocol Micro (captures in `research/protocol/`). It was not
taken from any vendor tool or SDK.

Formulas and formats, no code copied:
- Audio EQ Cookbook by Robert Bristow-Johnson: the biquad formulas for the response graph.
- The Equalizer APO / AutoEQ parametric text format: Contour reads and writes it with its own parser.
- squig.link: Contour shows the preamp the same way, as a reference for users who know it.

## 3. Fonts, icons and images

- Fonts: none bundled. On Pixel phones the app asks the system for its Google Sans font by name; elsewhere it
  uses the system sans-serif. Google Sans is not part of this project and is not distributed with it.
- Icons: Material Icons, from the AndroidX libraries in section 1 (Apache License 2.0).
- The launcher icon and all other graphics are drawn in code or as vector resources in this repo, under the
  project's Apache License 2.0.

## 4. Build and test tools (not inside the app)

- Gradle wrapper 9.7.1 (`android/gradlew`, `android/gradlew.bat`, `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`,
  kept in this repo), (c) the original authors, Apache License 2.0
- Android Gradle Plugin 9.4.1 with D8 and R8, (c) Google, Apache License 2.0
- Kotlin Gradle plugin, Compose compiler plugin and serialization plugin 2.4.20, (c) JetBrains, Apache License 2.0
- kotlin-test 2.4.20 (Apache License 2.0), JUnit Jupiter 5.10.1 and JUnit Platform 1.10.1 (Eclipse Public
  License 2.0), opentest4j 1.3.0 and apiguardian-api 1.1.2 (Apache License 2.0): used by the parity test only,
  downloaded by Gradle, not distributed
- JDK 21 and the Android SDK: needed to build, not distributed

## 5. Trademarks

CrinEar, Protocol Micro, WalkPlay, Google, Pixel, Google Sans, Android and all other product names belong to
their owners. Contour is an unofficial project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by any of them. Names are
used only to say which hardware and formats Contour works with.
