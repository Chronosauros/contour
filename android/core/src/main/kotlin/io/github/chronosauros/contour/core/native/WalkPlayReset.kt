/**
 * Factory reset of the WalkPlay DACs (Protocol Micro, Moondrop Echo-A, TRN Black Pearl): the "RESET" button of the WalkPlay web tool, decoded
 * (`s2.resetDevice`, walkplay-plan.md item 4, rank KOD). It is NOT hardware-seen. The sequence, report id 0x4B, in this order and never in part:
 *
 *  1. `01 03 02 00 00` - the preamp ("Volume") to 0 dB;
 *  2. eight band frames, i = 0..7, 36 bytes each: `01 09 18 00 i 00 00` + biquad (20 B) + freq + Q + gain + `02` + `00` + `01`; the vendor's "PURE" values:
 *     50 / 200 / 500 / 1000 / 2500 / 5000 / 10000 / 15000 Hz, Q 0.75 (register `C0 00`), 0 dB, PK; the length byte is 0x18 and the last byte before the end is 1;
 *  3. `01 0A 04 00 00 FF FF` - the vendor's "refereshToMemery" (the TEMP_WRITE of devicePEQ);
 *  4. `01 01 00` - "refereshToFlash";
 *  5. `01 05 01`, `01 05 02`, `01 05 03`, `01 05 04` - meaning unknown;
 *  6. `01 17 00` - meaning unknown (devicePEQ uses it as a commit step).
 *
 * What the DAC erases beyond the EQ is unknown (steps 5 and 6 are not understood), so a reset is never a plain write: [WalkPlayResetFlow] takes a complete
 * [WalkPlayResetBackup] (all bands, the preamp, every readable setting) and the owner's consent first, and only its [WalkPlayResetTicket] lets [sequence]
 * build the frames (one ticket, one sequence). [WalkPlayGuard] refuses `01 05 01..04` in every other context, and `01 17 00` and `01 05 00` on the TRN outside it,
 * and `05 01 02 00 FF` and `02 00 00 01 FF` (the reset candidates of other classes) in all of them.
 *
 * The TRN has 10 bands and the vendor's reset writes bands 0-7 only, with the length byte 0x18, while Contour's own TRN write sends 0x21 for 10 bands ([WalkPlay.TRN_BAND_LEN]).
 * Contour's normal TRN write is NOT changed. After a TRN reset the bench MUST read bands 8 and 9: the reset leaves them as they were (or the unit erases them: unknown),
 * and the backup holds them, so [WalkPlaySession.restoreAfterReset] writes the whole backup back through the ordinary TRN sequence.
 *
 * [VERIFIED] is the flag of the app, like [FiioReset.VERIFIED]: empty until a reset has been run on the unit from the PC bench and the restore brought everything back.
 * The bench (`reset-plan`) and the tests build the sequence regardless. The app reaches it from the DAC Settings page's FACTORY RESET row only through [enabled] ([Proven]):
 * a release build has no FACTORY RESET row (its settings page exists for the TRN only, where the DAC filter row is `writeVerified`; the Micro and the Echo-A get none), a review build runs it.
