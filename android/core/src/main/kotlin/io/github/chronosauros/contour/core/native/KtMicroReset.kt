/**
 * Factory reset of the KT Micro DAC (Kiwi Ears Allegro Mini): the vendor tool's CLEAR (register/command `0x43`, "clear flash"; Kiwi Ears Equalizer, devicePEQ's `COMMAND_CLEAR`).
 * The frame is `00 00 00 00 43 00 00 00 00 00` (report 0x4B); the vendor tool waits for the DAC to echo it with byte 6 = 3 ([KtMicroCatalog.RegisterMap.writeAck]) and sends nothing
 * after it (devicePEQ's `pushClearToDevice`; the sequence has no SAVE, and a SAVE after a clear would persist whatever the DAC holds then). NOT hardware-seen: what CLEAR restores
 * (the factory 1/2/5/8/10 kHz bands or the code defaults 28/84/680/4300/14500 Hz) and whether the DAC leaves the USB bus after it are unknown (`scope-kt-walkplay.md` 1.4, 1.7).
 *
 * So a reset is never a plain write, as for the FiiO ([FiioReset]) and WalkPlay ([WalkPlayReset]) DACs: [KtMicroResetFlow] takes a complete [KtMicroResetBackup] (the EQ switch, the ten
 * band registers, the Global Gain) and the owner's consent first, and only its [KtMicroResetTicket] lets [KtMicroCodec.compileClear] build the frame (one ticket, one frame).
 * [KtMicroCodec] builds `0x43` nowhere else, and the bench's deny-list lets exactly that frame out of `reset-plan --owner-consent` only.
 *
 * The restore writes the backup's own register bytes back ([KtMicroCodec.compileRestore]), then SAVE: the DAC leaves the bus after it, so the read that proves the restore comes after
 * a reconnect. There is no app path (no flag): the app keeps the CLEAR out until the bench has run it on the unit.
