/**

 * so the frames are the app's. [types] are the filter types the profile offers; [hardwareVerified] is false for a DAC no
 * write of Contour ever reached. The Moondrop Echo-A has no protocol of its own: it is a SchemeNo11 row of devicePEQ's catalog
 * (8 bands), driven by the Protocol Micro's code. [caps] are the limits the planner holds a band to: the protocol's own, or the
 * record's for the Echo-A (PK, LS, emulated HS, LP, HP; gain +-10 dB, Q 0.1-10). [preampMaxDb] is the top of the device preamp the planner takes:
 * 0 until [ProtocolMicro.microPositivePreampOn] (Micro) or [ProtocolMicro.echoAPositivePreampOn] (Echo-A): the vendor's +6 dB is unproven on each, [Proven]. Only the Micro's code reads it.
 *
 * [hardwareVerified] is the profile's own flag (what is proven); whether the app WRITES it is [writeOn] ([Proven.on]). [capsOverride] and [preampMaxOverride] replace the
 * protocol's current caps and preamp top (the bench and the tests widen a profile with them); null follows the protocol, which follows the gate at the time of the call.
