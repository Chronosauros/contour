/**
 * Factory reset of the SnowSky Melody and Tiny A and the FiiO KA15: FiiO command 0x21 (RESET_TO_FACTORY), the one place in Contour where that command can become a frame.
 *
 * Where it comes from: FiiO Control shows "restore factory settings" on the Melody and Tiny A (on the KA15 FiiO's own config hides it, `resetDefault.show:false`;
 * the owner decided on 21.10 to offer it there anyway, with the same flow and the same bench proof first); the payload (`21 01 00`: length 1, data 00) is the generic builder of FiiO's web app
 * (`Ye(170,10,33,[0])`-style helper in its bundle), NOT a capture from a Melody or Tiny A, and what the DAC erases is unknown (slots, names, settings,
 * perhaps all). So a reset is never a plain write: [FiioResetFlow] takes the owner's consent and a complete backup first, and only its
 * [FiioResetTicket] lets [FiioCodec.resetFrame] build the frame (one ticket, one frame). 0x21 stays impossible everywhere else: [FiioCodec.querySetting],
 * [FiioCodec.setSetting] ([DacWrite.NEVER_SEND]), [ProbePlan.FIIO_FORBIDDEN] and the save-command check refuse it.
 *
 * [VERIFIED] is the flag of the app, like [DacSetting.writeVerified]: empty until a reset has been run on the unit from the PC bench and the app's
 * restore brought the slots, names and settings back. The bench (`reset-plan`) and the tests build the frame regardless; the app shows the row dimmed.
