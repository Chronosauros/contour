/**
 * The DAC Settings page rows of the Contour 1.6 families, in the page's own [DacSetting] language. Kept apart from [DacSettings] (the FiiO and
 * WalkPlay lists); [DeviceTarget.settings] asks here for a target that has neither.
 *
 * The Dawn Pro 2 rows are reads. Its Pre Gain has a write path ([MoondropSession.writeGain], 0.1 dB, values in tenths of a dB here) and keeps [DacSetting.writeVerified] false until a unit
 * has proven the frame: enabling it later is that one flag. Its Global Gain is read only in every build (the unit ignores the write). The Allegro Mini's EQ switch (register 0x24) and its Global Gain
 * (register 0x3B, steps 1-15) have write paths ([KtMicroSession.writeSwitch] and [KtMicroSession.writeGlobalGain]); each counts as done only after the DAC is back on the bus and a read agrees.
 * Both passed the PC bench and the phone (EQ switch OFF/ON and Global Gain 1/15/13, each VERIFIED after the re-enumeration, and persistence over a replug: Pixel run 2026-10-24-kiwi-ears-allegro-mini-04-phone), so [DacSetting.writeVerified] is true. The readers are not
 * [SettingRead.FiiO]-style frames: the controller fills the rows from the read state ([FamilyState.readings]); the [SettingRead] is only the
 * page's "this row has a reader" mark.
