/**
 * THE gate of every write, reset and widened limit that no unit has proven yet. One policy, one function:
 *
 *   `Proven.on(flag)` = the feature's own flag is true (proven on hardware), or the build is a review build.
 *
 * The flags stay where the features are and stay the single source of what is proven: [ProtocolMicro.PASS_FILTERS_VERIFIED], [ProtocolMicro.MICRO_POSITIVE_PREAMP_VERIFIED], [ProtocolMicro.ECHO_A_POSITIVE_PREAMP_VERIFIED],
 * [ProtocolTrn.PASS_FILTERS_VERIFIED] (LP and HP on the TRN Black Pearl), [io.github.chronosauros.contour.core.native.MoondropCatalog.PASS_FILTERS_VERIFIED] (LP and HP on the Dawn Pro 2), [io.github.chronosauros.contour.core.native.MoondropCatalog.SHELVES_VERIFIED] (LS and HS on the Dawn Pro 2),
 * [io.github.chronosauros.contour.core.native.SnowSkyMelody.PASS_FILTERS_VERIFIED] (LP, HP, BP and AP on the SnowSky Melody),
 * [io.github.chronosauros.contour.core.native.FiioKa15.PASS_FILTERS_VERIFIED] (LP, HP, BP and AP on the FiiO KA15),
 * [io.github.chronosauros.contour.core.native.WalkPlayProfiles.ECHO_A_HARDWARE_VERIFIED] (the profile's `hardwareVerified`), a model's `hardwareVerified` (Dawn Pro 2, Allegro Mini EQ
 * writes), [io.github.chronosauros.contour.core.native.DacSetting.writeVerified] (every settings row), [io.github.chronosauros.contour.core.native.FiioReset.VERIFIED] and
 * [io.github.chronosauros.contour.core.native.WalkPlayReset.VERIFIED] (the factory resets). A code path asks `Proven.on(flag)` and never looks at the build type itself, so a
 * flag turning true on its own is the only way a release build starts to send something new.
 *
 * The app sets [channel] once, first thing in `Application.onCreate`, from its build type ([channelFor]); everything else (the bench, the tests) is a release.
 * A feature that is on only because the build is a review build keeps its "not verified on hardware" wording: the gate decides whether it runs, not what it is called.
