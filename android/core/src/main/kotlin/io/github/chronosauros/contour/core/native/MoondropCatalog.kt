 * Native Moondrop (report 0x4B, 64 bytes with the ID). Only the Dawn Pro 2 (USB name "DAWN PRO2") is here: the one
 * Moondrop identity read on hardware (DacLab, 21.10.2026). Names and limits are the manufacturer's (MOONDROP Hub, hub.moondroplab.com,
 * read 21.10.2026), not devicePEQ's: 8 bands, types PK, LS, HS, LP, HP (no BP, no AP), gain -18..+12 dB, Q 0.1-10, 20-20000 Hz, one
 * writable PEQ banks = EQ index 7 ("PEQ mode") and 9 (the owner's unit, firmware 1.5, stays on 9 and takes the Hub's write there). Other EQ indices are the unit's own presets: never written.
 *
 * Registers, as the manufacturer names them: 0x0F EQ index, 0x09 band, 0x0A coefficient commit, 0x01 EQ save, 0x03 GLOBAL GAIN
 * (DAC offset, -18..0 dB; advBeta called this "pregain"), 0x23 PRE-GAIN (the preamp, -128..0 dB), 0x04 offset save.
 * Never sent: 0x05 (flash clear, `01 05 01 04`), 0xFF (firmware update entry), 0x04 (offset save: the manufacturer's write does not use it).
