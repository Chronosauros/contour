/**
 * The app's transport for report 0x4B: the WalkPlay session ([io.github.chronosauros.contour.core.native.WalkPlaySession], 63 bytes after the
 * report ID) and the Contour 1.6 family sessions (Moondrop Dawn Pro 2, Kiwi Ears Allegro Mini, Moondrop Echo-A), which use the same report ID.
 * Protocol Micro, Max and TRN keep the way they were opened since 1.2 (first HID interface, plain reports); every 1.6 family is opened through
 * its report descriptor and uses the native calls. [tick] is told after every report sent and every reply taken (the progress of a send).
 * The session owns the frames, the pauses and the attempts of a request; this port sends once, drops the stale input first and waits 200 ms.
